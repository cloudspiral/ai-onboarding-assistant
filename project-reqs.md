# AI-Powered Onboarding Assistant

## Difficulty & Timebox
**Tier:** Mid–Senior · **Timebox:** 3 days · **Format:** take-home assessment
**Target industry:** Sensitive-service onboarding

*(Raised from 2 days: the +1 day is justified by the combined scope of OCR/document
extraction and an LLM chatbot, plus first-class handling of sensitive PII.)*

## Problem Statement
Build an AI-powered onboarding assistant for users registering for specialized
services. Onboarding today fails for two reasons: registration involves complex,
error-prone data entry (re-typing details from ID and other documents), and users
often arrive under emotional stress, which raises the friction of every extra step.
The assistant reduces both: an LLM chatbot guides the user and performs an initial
assessment, an image-to-text step lets the user photograph a document instead of
typing, an appointment scheduler books the right next step, and supportive content
is surfaced at the moments users are most likely to abandon.
Target user: a person signing up for a specialized (and potentially sensitive)
service who wants to finish onboarding quickly, with minimal typing and minimal stress.

## Business Context
Specialized-service onboarding has high abandonment because it front-loads friction —
long forms, manual document transcription, and uncertainty about next steps — on
users who may already be anxious. Every abandoned registration is a lost customer
plus wasted acquisition spend, so reducing drop-off directly improves conversion and
lowers customer-acquisition cost. Turning a bureaucratic form into a guided, low-typing,
supportive flow is also a durable differentiator in a domain where the emotional quality
of the first interaction shapes long-term trust and retention.

## Illustrative Business Case / Impact Metrics
*Illustrative — assumptions stated inline; validate against real analytics.*
- **Onboarding completion rate:** raise completion from an assumed baseline of
  **~50%** to **~70%** (**+20 pts, ~+40% relative**), by removing manual data entry
  and next-step uncertainty. *(Assumption: 50% baseline is typical for a long,
  document-heavy flow; confirm against product analytics before quoting externally.)*
- **Process efficiency:** a motivated user completes onboarding in **≤ 15 minutes**
  (baseline assumed 25–30 min for a manual, multi-form flow).
- **User satisfaction:** **NPS 70+** target for the onboarding experience.
  *(Note: NPS 70 is ambitious — world-class territory; treat as an aspirational
  target, not a pass condition, and measure the direction of travel.)*
- **Response time (product guardrail):** **< 3 s p95** system response under a stated
  load — see Performance Benchmarks; slow responses re-introduce the friction the
  product exists to remove.

## Tech Stack
Concrete free-tier defaults; substitution allowed if justified and benchmarks met.
**No paid API is required.**
- **Required Languages:** Ruby on Rails (API/backend), JavaScript/TypeScript.
- **Frontend:** Next.js (React/TypeScript).
- **AI Frameworks:**
  - **LLM (chatbot + assessment):** **Groq free tier** or **Google Gemini free tier**
    or **Ollama (local)** — pick one; **no paid API required.** Claude or OpenAI are
    **optional** substitutes only, not required.
  - **OCR / document processing:** **Tesseract** or **PaddleOCR** (both free,
    self-hostable). Cloud OCR is an optional substitute, not required.
- **Development Tools:** Git, Docker, RSpec (or Jest for the frontend).
- **Cloud Platforms:** **Render** or **Railway** (app hosting, free tier) +
  **Supabase** (free — Postgres + Auth, well suited to onboarding/identity).
  A major cloud provider (**AWS / GCP / Azure**) is listed only as an **optional
  substitute** — not required, and not the default.

## Functional Requirements
Each Core item has an observable acceptance criterion (pass/fail). Golden sets and
thresholds are defined in **AI Metrics & Test Method**.

### Core (must-have)
1. **LLM assessment chatbot** — a conversational flow gathers the required onboarding
   information and produces a structured assessment/summary.
   *Accept:* the chatbot correctly handles every intent in the defined intent list
   (see AI Metrics) and, given a scripted conversation, emits a structured record
   with all required fields populated; unrecognized inputs get a graceful fallback
   rather than an error.
2. **Image-to-text data entry** — the user uploads a photo of an ID/document and the
   system pre-fills the form.
   *Accept:* on the OCR golden set, the system extracts **name, date of birth, and
   address** at **≥ 90% field-level accuracy**, and every extracted field is shown
   to the user for confirmation/edit before it is saved.
3. **Appointment scheduling** — the user books a next-step appointment from available
   slots.
   *Accept:* a user can view open slots, book one, receive a confirmation, and a
   double-booking of the same slot is rejected; the booking persists across sessions.
4. **Supportive content surfacing** — relevant reassurance/help content is shown at
   friction points.
   *Accept:* given a defined set of trigger conditions (e.g. long pause, upload
   failure, high-stress intent detected), the correct supportive content is surfaced
   for each trigger, and content is never shown when no trigger condition is met.

### Stretch (bonus)
5. **Multi-language support** — chatbot and content available in ≥ 2 languages.
6. **Sentiment-adaptive tone** — the assistant detects user stress/sentiment and
   adapts tone and pacing accordingly.
7. **Advanced analytics** — a dashboard of funnel drop-off, per-step completion time,
   and OCR correction rates.

### Edge Cases & Failure Modes
The solution **must** handle the following; each is an observable expectation, not a
"nice to have". Happy-path-only submissions that skip these should visibly fail review.
- **OCR failure → manual-entry fallback.** When OCR returns no result, low confidence,
  or errors on an image, the flow does not dead-end: the user is offered manual field
  entry and can complete onboarding without the photo step — never an unhandled 500.
- **Partial extraction shown for confirmation.** When OCR extracts only some fields
  (e.g. name + DOB but not address), the successfully read fields are pre-filled and
  clearly marked for confirmation/edit, and the missing fields are left blank for the
  user to complete — the system never silently drops or fabricates a field.
- **Consent revocation + data deletion honored.** A user who withdraws consent, or
  requests deletion, has their document image and extracted PII purged, and processing
  stops; the revocation is logged and the deletion is verifiable (record no longer
  retrievable).
- **Malformed / oversized / non-image upload rejected.** Uploads are validated
  server-side for file type and size; a non-image, corrupt, or over-limit file is
  rejected with a clear user-facing message rather than crashing or being processed.
- **PII never in logs.** Extracted identity fields, raw document images, and chatbot
  transcripts containing PII are never written to application logs, error traces, or
  analytics events — only non-identifying metadata (e.g. field-level success/failure).
- **LLM timeout / failure fallback.** When the LLM provider times out, returns a 5xx,
  or is unreachable, the chatbot degrades gracefully — a clear "try again / continue
  manually" path — never a hang, an unhandled error, or a hallucinated commitment.

## Performance Benchmarks
Load is defined explicitly so results are comparable across candidates.
**Stated load:** 20 concurrent virtual users for 60 s, generated with **k6**
(script committed to the repo).

| Target | Value | Measurement method |
|--------|-------|--------------------|
| Chatbot / API response | < 3.0 s p95 | k6 run at the stated load (20 VUs, 60 s); report p95 |
| OCR extraction latency | < 8.0 s p95 | API timing from image upload receipt to extracted-fields response, 20 runs |
| Scheduling / booking action | < 1.0 s p95 | Server log timing, 20 runs |
| Uptime (deployed demo) | ≥ 99% over the eval window | Uptime check (e.g. cron ping) across the review period |

## AI Metrics & Test Method
- **OCR golden set:** **30 labeled sample ID/documents**, each with expected fields
  (name, DOB, address), spanning clean scans, phone photos, and mild skew/glare;
  includes at least a few near-miss/hard cases. *Threshold:* **≥ 90% field-level
  accuracy** across the extracted fields.
- **Chatbot intent-coverage set:** a defined **intent list** (e.g. provide-details,
  ask-question, request-reschedule, express-distress, out-of-scope) with labeled
  example utterances per intent. *Threshold:* the chatbot routes/handles **every
  intent in the list**, and out-of-scope inputs get a graceful fallback (no crash,
  no hallucinated commitment).
- **Method:** a committed test harness (e.g. `rake ai:eval`) runs both sets and prints
  a scorecard (per-field OCR accuracy, per-intent pass/fail). Model versions, OCR
  engine version, and hardware are recorded in the README. **Sample IDs in the golden
  set must be synthetic/dummy documents — never real user PII.**

## Security, Privacy & Compliance
This domain is explicitly sensitive: it involves emotional stress, specialized
services, and image-to-text of ID/documents (heavy PII). Sensitive-data handling is
**first-class**, not an add-on.
- **Consent capture:** explicit, logged user consent is required before any document
  image is uploaded or processed; the user is told what is collected and why.
- **PII data minimization:** collect and retain only the fields the flow needs;
  do not store the raw document image longer than required to extract and confirm
  fields (extract → confirm → discard image by default).
- **Encryption:** TLS/HTTPS in transit; encryption at rest for the database and any
  stored documents/images.
- **Secure handling of uploaded IDs:** private storage only (signed URLs, never public
  buckets); a stated **retention and deletion policy** (default: purge the source
  image after successful extraction/confirmation), and the user can request deletion
  of their data on demand.
- **Access control:** per-user authN/authZ (Supabase Auth); a user can only access
  their own onboarding record; any staff/admin access is role-scoped and audit-logged.
- **Model/data boundary:** prefer local OCR (Tesseract/PaddleOCR) and a self-hosted or
  free-tier LLM so PII need not leave your infrastructure; if a cloud AI API is used,
  disclose it and avoid sending raw ID images to third parties.
- **Regulatory note:** if the specialized service is **healthcare or financial**, the
  corresponding compliance regime applies (**HIPAA** for health data, **PCI DSS** for
  payment data) — candidates should note which regime applies to their assumed domain
  and how the design supports it.

## Code Quality & Engineering Practices
- **Test coverage ≥ 80%** on core logic (OCR extraction/mapping service, chatbot
  orchestration, scheduling state).
- **Error handling & graceful degradation:** every primary external dependency failing
  (OCR engine, LLM provider, database, network) degrades gracefully with a clear
  user-facing message — graceful fallbacks for failed OCR (offer manual entry) and
  failed LLM calls (retry/queue or manual path); no unhandled 500s and no silent wrong
  results in the demo flow.
- **Observability baseline:** structured error logging (PII-free) and a **health-check
  endpoint** for the API that reports app and dependency (DB/OCR/LLM) reachability.
- **Database migrations & seed:** schema managed via committed migrations, and a
  committed **seed script / fixtures** (including the OCR golden set of synthetic
  documents) so the app runs and is gradeable from a clean checkout.
- **Secure coding for PII:** no secrets in the repo — configuration via environment
  only, with a committed **`.env.example`** documenting every required variable; no PII
  in logs; input validation and file-type/size checks on uploads.
- **Accessibility:** the frontend meets a baseline — keyboard navigation, labeled form
  controls, sufficient color contrast, and status conveyed by more than color alone.
- **CI:** runs tests + linter (RuboCop / ESLint) on every push; README documents
  setup, env vars, and the AI eval harness.

## AI Usage Disclosure
**Required.** Document, in `AI_USAGE.md`: which AI tools were used and for what
(codegen, OCR, chatbot/assessment, sentiment), which LLM/OCR engines and versions,
and any prompts or configuration that materially shaped the solution.

## Submission Requirements
- GitHub repository (with README + `AI_USAGE.md`)
- Committed **seed script / fixtures** and the synthetic OCR golden set, plus a
  `.env.example`, so the app runs and is gradeable from a clean checkout with no real PII.
- **Grader quick-start:** the README must let a reviewer run the app, seed data, and the
  test + AI eval harness **in minutes** — setup steps, environment variables, seed
  command, demo credentials (if any), and how to run the committed test suite.
- Deployed application URL
- Documentation
- Video demo (showing the chatbot flow, image-to-text data entry with confirmation,
  a booking, and supportive-content surfacing)
